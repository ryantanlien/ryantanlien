At Ascenda, as a Software Engineer 1 in the Data Services and Integrations Team, I:
- Implemented pagination for the batch processing pipeline API with SQL, improving API performance for internal clients by 1000x, reducing response time from 10s to 9ms
- Drove an initiative to introduce real-time push-based metrics with Statsd to closely monitor the batch processing lifetime, increasing fine-grained observability and enabling performance enhancements.
- Overhauled the data processing email alert system to be configurable by tenants and use Unleash to roll-out the feature using canary deployments across different partners and tenants.
- Implemented GUI navigation of remote SFTP servers and SFTP file removal end-to-end using Tailwind CSS and Ruby, thereby improving the usability and user experience of operations dashboards for L1 support personnel

At Ascenda, as a Part-time Software Engineer 1 in the Data Services and Integrations Team, I:
- Decreased response time of incidents by using Prometheus with Grafana to create dashboards that monitor application data processing performance and progress, sending alerts via OpsGenie when unacceptable slowdowns occur.
- Use GitHub Actions to introduce a performance verifcation workflow to prevent performance related regressions
- Reduced risk of incorrect data patching in the ELT data pipeline by introducing Alembic as database migration software.
- Reduce the technical debt of the codebase by improving error handling, ensuring the codebase is flexible and extensible enough to scale.

At Ascenda, as a Software Engineer Intern in the Loyalty Data Team, I:
- Collaborated in the Loyalty Data Team to write production code for developing and maintaining a large volume 
parallel data processing backend microservice known as Loyalty Engine.
- Use test-driven development to achieve a 90% path coverage, engendering high confidence in bug-free features in 
production. 
- Wrote APIs which exposes the business rules for points accumulation from the backend for a user-facing, self
serve loyalty points dashboard serving 20% of Ascendaâ€™s enterprise clients with Ruby and PostgreSQL. - Engineered APIs that expose business rules for points accumulation
- Refactored the Object Relational Mapping layer of the entire application as part of a migration initiative to use a 
new framework, paving the way for future performance improvements that reduced memory consumption by 25%
